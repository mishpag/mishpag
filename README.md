# Hi, I'm Michelleâ€”@mishpag

I have over six years of experience in content writing, technical writing, proposal and grant writing, and editing for the public and nonprofit sectors. I have experience writing proposals and documentation for topics in STEM, technology, Higher Education, and Pre-College programs (grades 6-12). Some of my most notable proposals are to the National Science Foundation and the US Department of Education.

I can quickly grasp new concepts and am willing to learn new things to ensure quality and detailed work. Currently, I'm looking to transition into the Software development industry.
